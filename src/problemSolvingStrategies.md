## Problem Solving
### How to improve...
1. Come up with a plan for solving the problem(s)
2. Practice common problem solving patterns, if you can identify patterns/steps that help you solve the problem. 

### Problem solving <-- a lot comes up with time... -->
1. Understand the problem!
    - Try not to dive into solving the problem and make sure you understand the task
    - Ask questions, yourself or interviewer:
        - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
        - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        - What are the expected outputs, what should it look like?
        - Do I have enough info to solve the problem, what else should I consider?
        - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem? 
2. Explore Concrete Examples
    - Come up with concrete examples can help you understand the problem better and if you know the inputs and outputs, it helps you check your work. 
    - Helps you learn more about your challenge
    - Unit Tests helps how features should work
        - Start with simple examples
        - Progress with empty inputs, invalid inputs
        - explore examples with empty string, are they passing null? empty string?
3. Break it Down 
- Communicate what you are doing, talking out loud and writing out the steps you need to take, helps you think about your code before you write it and helps you check for understanding and catch any conceptual issues/misunderstandings before you code
4. Solve/simplify - brute force
 - Write your code and solve if you can or solve a simpler problem...
 - temporarily ignore the part that is giving you the hard time, working on parts of the problem that you do understand, 
 - incorporate that difficulty back in
- review and refactor!!
    - it's important to strive to get clean code and try to improve the code, look back and reflect, is it readable? efficient? can you understand at it at a glance? can you think of other ways to refactor? can you check the results? can you improve performance? is there a different way of solving a problem?
